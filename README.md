# CA4007
Computer Graphics &amp; Image Processing

Learning Outcomes

1. Understand and analyse the computer graphics pipeline - 3D geometric primitives, 3D transformation, camera transformation, lighting, projection, clipping, rasterisation.
2. Understand the operation of a 3D computer graphics API - including translation, rotation and scaling of 3D objects, primitives (points, lines, polygons), attributes (size, colour), projection, illumination, animation
3. Design and program an application using a 3D graphics API - including the various function libraries, the range of functions for describing the 3D scene, projection onto a 2D viewing surface, control of the display window, interactivity including events and callbacks, hidden surface removal
4. Analyse digital images using the Fourier Transform algorithm - including an understanding of the space and frequency domains, high-pass and low-pass filtering, texture detection, shifting and scaling
5. Understand and apply the Convolution Theorem - including the concepts of linear shift-invariance, impulse response, the connection between convolution and Fourier Transforms, high- and low-pass filtering viewed as a convolution
6. Apply the concepts of sampling and replication - how sampling an image leads to replication in the Fourier domain, using convolution to increase the resolution of an image, anti-aliasing to reduce artifacts when an image is downsampled
